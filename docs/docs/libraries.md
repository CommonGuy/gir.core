# Libraries

Currently there are bindings for multiple libraries available to use with C# on Linux: [Gtk], [WebkitGTK], [libshumate] [libadwaita], [GIO], [gstreamer].

## GTK
[Gtk] is the toolkit which is used to display windows and widgets on the screen. The widgets can be added directly in code or described through an xml file.

Supported widgets are for example: Windows, dialogs, labels, images, spinner, progressbars, several buttons and switches, textboxes, tables,  lists, menus, toolbars, popovers, and much more. It powers several linux desktops like [Gnome] and [Xfce] and applications like [Gimp].

Visit the [GTK samples](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/tree/main/src/Samples/Gtk-4.0) to get an overview.

## libadwaita
[libadwaita] extends GTK with new widgets to comply to the GNOME human interface guidelines. Additionally it supports mobile devices meaning full blown applications automatically adopt their UI to different view modes, if the available space changes.

Visit the [libadwaita samples](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/tree/main/src/Samples/Adw-1/) to get an overview.

## GIO
[GIO] is a library to allow easy access to input / output operations. Currently there is initial support for [DBus] operations. DBus is a standardized IPC-Framework which all major linux desktops use for interprocess communication.

Visit the [GIO samples](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/tree/main/src/Samples/Gio-2.0/) to get an overview.

## GStreamer
[GStreamer] is a multimedia library to play back various media format via a flexible pipelining system.

Visit the [GStreamer samples](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/tree/main/src/Samples/Gst-1.0/) to get an overview.

## WebKitGTK
[WebKitGTK] is a browser component for GTK and can be used to embed the webkit webengine into an application as a widget. There is support for the web inspector and several settings to tweak the webview to your needs. WebKitGTK only supports Linux.

The bindings make it easy to:
* Embed javascript into a webpage
* Call a javascript function
* Callback from the webpage into the C# code.

Visit the [WebKit samples](https://github.com/gircore/gir.core/tree/main/src/Samples/WebKit2-5.0/) to get an overview.

## libshumate (planned)
[libshumate] is map component for GTK and can be used to embed maps into an application widget. By default it uses openstreetmap.
